Some thoughts on the dynamic cites demo

1. Not sure how to set this up to integrate with tinyMCE
   (or whether that is possible). tinyMCE does have a
   hook for responding to events, but not sure if an
   object can easily be injected into its context,
   or operate on the iframe DOM.

2. Placeholder insertion at the chevrons is a cheat,
   and the current code is bound tightly to that
   method. Would be better to hang thd menu off of the
   html:citation span itself, and just blow it away when
   the citation text is inserted or the operation is
   cancelled. Two birds with one stone.

3. Again thinking tinyMCE, not sure where the menu should
   run---in the page DOM, or inside tinyMCE itself (again,
   if that is possible). Currently it's running in page
   context.
